What is git / What is version control ?

- Git is a version control system (VCS)
- Problems when we don't use VCS ?
	* Hard disk failure or computer crash
	* Hard for multiple people to work on same code 
	* Difficult to track changes, rever back to previous version
	
- VCS solvers all those problems
	* Sync it up from cloud 
	* Multiple people work on same code. Golden copy is maintained on cloud. Code merge happens using mergetool.
	* VCS maintains version history, you can revert to any the previous state of your code.
	
- different VCS systems
	* git
	* mercurial
	* subversion
	* ..
- Git is the best by far VCS, because of 
	* Distributed version control system
	* Github - very popular website to host code is based on git
